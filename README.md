A rendering utility library for Minecraft. Fabric and Forge builds cover 1.20.1, 1.21.1, 1.21.11, and 26.1.2; the NeoForge build targets 26.1.2. Quilt uses the Fabric artifact.
</p>

## Development runs

Use a JDK matching the selected Minecraft version (Java 17 for 1.20.1, Java 21 for
1.21.x, and Java 25 for 26.1.2). Every Stonecutter target exposes the loader's
normal `runClient` task. Convenience aliases are available from the root:

```text
./gradlew runFabric1201Client   ./gradlew runForge1201Client
./gradlew runFabric1211Client   ./gradlew runForge1211Client
./gradlew runFabric12111Client  ./gradlew runForge12111Client
./gradlew runFabric2612Client   ./gradlew runForge2612Client
```

On Windows, replace `./gradlew` with `.\gradlew.bat`. IntelliJ also imports a
client launch configuration for every Forge target from ForgeGradle.

### NeoForge and Quilt

Build NeoForge for Minecraft 26.1.2 with `./gradlew :neoforge:build` and launch it
with `./gradlew :neoforge:runNeoForgeClient`. Install Forgified Fabric API alongside
Amnetic; ImGuiMC is optional for the editor.

For Quilt, install the Fabric artifact and Fabric API. Start the Quilt development
client with `./gradlew :26.1.2-fabric:runClient -Ploader_platform=quilt` (replace the
Minecraft version for another target). Quilt development runs keep model libraries
in a separate folder so Quilt loads them through the correct classloader.

The ImGui editor is available on Fabric, Quilt and NeoForge; Forge builds omit it.

### Iris shader packs

Amnetic composites local lights after Iris finishes the shader-pack image. Lights
use the pack's camera matrices and world depth, so they follow ground and visible
surfaces rather than being overwritten by the pack. Dark surfaces retain a visible
light response, with a soft brightness limit to avoid washed-out highlights.

Shader packs retain their own sunlight, shadows and temporal antialiasing. Amnetic's
local-light composite does not feed the pack's reflections or bloom, and Amnetic
shadow maps and screen effects stay disabled while a pack is active. With shaders
turned off, Amnetic's normal rendering and effects remain available.

### Lighting performance

Local lights default to Balanced quality. With eight or more visible lights, Amnetic
renders their contribution at 75% resolution and upsamples it using scene depth.
The world image stays at full resolution. Small light counts, directional lights,
custom shading and Iris lighting keep their existing full-resolution path.

In the editor, open **Renderer → Lights → Global lighting → Lighting quality**:
High uses full resolution, Balanced uses 75%, and Performance uses 50%. Lower modes
can soften lighting at thin edges. They do not reduce shadow-map or volumetric costs.

Without the editor, add `-Damnetic.lightingQuality=performance` to the launcher's
JVM arguments (or use `high` / `balanced`). Mods can set the scale through
`LightSettings.defaults().surfaceScale(0.5f)`.

## Installation

Amnetic is a **standalone mod**. Install it as a separate mod (e.g. from Modrinth)
alongside any mod that uses it. Please **do not bundle it (Jar-in-Jar) inside your own mod**.
Bundling is unsupported: a single shared install is supportable, and when multiple mods
each ship their own copy, Fabric loads one and shadows the rest, causing version
mismatches and conflicts. Amnetic logs a warning if it detects it was loaded nested.

**Players:** download the Amnetic build for your Minecraft version and loader, then drop it
in your `mods` folder next to the mods that depend on it.

**Fabric developers:** depend on it without bundling. Add the repository and a
`modImplementation` dependency to your `build.gradle`:

```groovy
repositories {
    maven { url "https://maven.meekhasto.rest" }
}

dependencies {
    // modImplementation (not `include`): Amnetic ships as its own mod
    modImplementation "com.meekdev:amnetic:{version}"
}
```

Then declare it as a dependency in your `fabric.mod.json` so users are pointed to install it:

```json
"depends": {
    "amnetic": ">={version}"
}
```


## Features

- **Post-processing** - fullscreen effects from JSON pipelines, conditional, faded, with dynamic uniforms.
- **Compute shaders** - dispatch `.comp` programs with SSBOs and textures, behind a capability probe.
- **Particles** - CPU-simulated, GPU-billboarded, with affectors, soft depth, and surface colliders.
- **Instanced rendering** - one mesh, thousands of instances, custom layouts and shaders.
- **World meshes** - generic world-space geometry render type with your own shaders.
- **Camera** - queries, additive effects (shake/kick/FOV), and a cinematic director.
- **Animation** - a tween/timeline engine with easing, repeat, and interpolators.
- **Framebuffers** - off-screen render targets, MRT, depth capture, main-frame blits, ping-pong passes.
- **Bloom** - emissive/bright-pixel glow over the deferred renderer.
- **Deferred lights** - point, spot, directional, area, and tube lights, lit from depth and normals.
- **Shadows** - per-light depth-mapped shadows for spot and point lights (soft PCF/PCSS, coloured, entity occluders).
- **Volumetric god-rays** - per-light single-scattering shafts at reduced resolution with temporal reprojection.
- **Screen-space AO/GI** - SSAO (with temporal denoise) and a one-bounce SSGI pass.
- **Decals** - projected box decals that can also write the gbuffer (normal/roughness) to relight surfaces.
- **Particle editor** - in-game tool to author particle effects (curves, gradient, affectors, trails) and save/load them as JSON.
- **Models (glTF / OBJ)** - loaded into the instanced pipeline with PBR metallic-roughness materials, deferred-lit (clip-based animation player included; geometry skinning not yet implemented).
- **Scene capture** - render the world from a virtual camera; planar-reflection mirrors.
- **Entity effects** - run a custom shader over an entity's body, or override its texture.
- **Mesh tap** - read a posed entity's vertices for particles and custom geometry.

Planned: FrameGraph pass injection.
